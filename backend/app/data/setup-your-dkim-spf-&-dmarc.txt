How To Set Up Your DKIM, SPF and DMARC
Updated over a week ago
Note: The following steps are specifically for those using Google as their domain and mail provider. Before applying these values, verify with your provider, as they typically have their own guides.

 

How To Set Up DKIM
Log in at admin.google.com.

Navigate to Menu > Apps > Google Workspace > Gmail > Authenticate Email.

Generate a DKIM Key.

Create a DNS TXT record with this key at your domain provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Squarespace).

How To Set Up SPF
Go to your domain admin site and find DNS Management or Settings.

Locate any existing SPF records (they start with "v=spf1â€¦").

If there's an existing SPF record, you should be good to go!

If there isn't, add a TXT record with the name "@" and the value:

 

For a standard Google Workspace (Google for Business) account:

v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
 

For a standard Office 365 (Outlook for Business) account:

v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
 

If you need to add a hostname, make it: @

How To Set Up DMARC
Go to your domain admin site and find DNS Management or Settings.

Add a new TXT record with one of the following values:

 

Host Name: 

_dmarc

 

Value: 

v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:your_email@example.com;

 

Replace the placeholder email with your own - it can be any of your company emails.
