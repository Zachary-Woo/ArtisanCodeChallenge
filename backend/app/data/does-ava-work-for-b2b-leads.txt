Does Ava Work for B2C Leads?
Updated over a week ago
You can use Ava for B2C email campaigns, but it does require extra input on your part. 

 

Right now, Ava’s database exclusively features B2B leads. If you’re using Ava for a B2C email campaign, you’ll need to upload your own spreadsheet populated with the necessary information to generate email copy. You can learn how to do this here: https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/9191308-how-do-i-upload-a-csv-file-of-my-own-leads

 

We're working hard to introduce new features to our platform and hope to add B2C leads into Ava’s database soon!
