We’re Spearheading the
Next Industrial Revolution
Work is changing forever. At Artisan, we're pioneering this AI Renaissance by bringing autonomous AI employees to the mainstream, starting with our AI BDR, Ava.

We’re Not Creating AI Agents -
We’re Creating Artisans.
Thousands of companies are developing faceless AI agents to automate specific tasks – we’re taking a different approach.

Our Artisans act as additional team members, seamlessly integrating with your workforce, taking over tasks where they excel, and collaborating with humans when needed.

Founded in 2023, Artisan's founding team consists of incredible talent from Stanford, Oxford, Meta, IBM, and more.

We're a team united by the passion for completely revolutionizing the way we work.

Our vision: A world where Artisans and humans work together in symbiosis.
Our goal might be ambitious, but it takes a bold vision like ours to propel humanity forwards.

Our team is committed to being the best at everything we do - from the products and features we release to the way we onboard and support our customers.
